-Compile and run:
    -Run makefile ("make")
    -Execute the calc using the command "./calc filename" where filename is your input file
    -See the quads that your file produces. We recommend having the terminal window a bit stretched for better view

-Implementation:
    -Partial relop was NOT implemented
    -It will probably miss some error checking. Or maybe throw segmentation when there is mistake in the alpha code file
    -At break and continue stmts used a stack to store the breaklist and contlist labels that will be used to unfinished jumps quads
