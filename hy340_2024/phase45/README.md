-Compile and run the whole project:
    -Go to phase45 directory
    -Run makefile
    -Execute the calc using the command "./calc filename" where filename is your input file
    -See the quads that your file produces. We recommend having the terminal window a bit stretched for better view

-Compile and run phase 4
    -Same steps with above at phase4 directory



-Implementation:
    -Added some extra code in some given testfiles(from phase3) to further test the VM(mostly for library functions)
    -Tables were not implemented (only code from lectures)
    -Problem with userfuncs and calls
    -Labels do not work correctly at branches. They remain zero and VM runs forever.
